# Stay or Leave

About a year ago someone came to me with an idea for a project related to watching movies. The basic idea was that you would be going to see a movie, and you wanted to know whether or not it was worth staying after the movie to see the credits, i.e., whether there were any funny outtake clips, previews, or anything else that would make you want to stay and watch the credits.

This project called out to be a mobile app, so I whipped up a prototype using Sencha Touch. This project contains that prototype code.

Sadly the client did not secure any funding, so this project died an untimely death.

## Seeing the UI

To see the code in action, just download it to an HTTP web server (I use MAMP for development), then look at it in your browser. If it doesn't work on your computer, sorry about your luck, it works just fine on mine. (That's a hint that I won't be supporting this project, I have too many other things to do.)
